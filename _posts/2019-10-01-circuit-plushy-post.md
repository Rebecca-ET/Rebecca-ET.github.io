This project involved creating a circuit plushy that lights up when you press the button. 

First, I made a paper prototype.

The electronic components were connected with conductive thread.

The temperature in the screeenshot above was 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

Tip to past self: Borrow a Mac from the library. Setting up your PC was and continues to be a headache.


  Include a description of the project (in your words), and one tip/trick/hint for others attempting this project for the first time.
