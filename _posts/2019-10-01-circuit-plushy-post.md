This project involved creating a circuit plushy that lights up when you press the button. 

First, I made a paper prototype based on the Simple Circuits Assignment.

Then I tested that the lights would turn on with the alligator clips.

After that, I connected the electronic components with conductive thread, sewed the plushy together, and filled it with stuffing.

And it works!

Tip: Use the sparkfun education website to learn the basics of e-sewing. 
When sewing the electronic components together with conductive thread, do not stitch across a component and make sure that the plus and minus sides are matched up as they should be.
