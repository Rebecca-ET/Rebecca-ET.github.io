For the Separate Sparkles Assignment, we programmed three different light patterns into three sets of ProtoSnap LEDs to mimic three types of firefly flash patterns.

1. Flash Bulb Firefly: flashes for half a second every 4 seconds

2. Synchronous Firefly: flashes for 0.2 seconds in a series of 3 flashes every 10 seconds

3. Big Dipper Firefly: flashes every 3 seconds, glowing with increasing light

Tip to past self: Figuring out the time controls can be tricky at first. Play around with it and then visit the professor/TA for alternative methods.
