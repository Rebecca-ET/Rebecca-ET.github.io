For the Odd Menu Assignment, I wrote a program to represent a restaurant menu, using nested if statements. 
One can order from either the Secret or Regular Menu depending on whether the numberChoice is odd or even, and there are 3 mealOptions to choose from on each menu.

The numberChoice in the screenshot below is 61, and the mealOption is 2. Since the number is odd, it leads to the Secret Menu, and the second option on this menu is Squirrel Brains.

Tip to past self: Use modular arithmetic to distinguish odd and even numbers in your code.
