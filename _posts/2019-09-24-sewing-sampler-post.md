**Turned into 9 Different Stitches:**

Whip Stitch, Back Stitch, Running Stitch, Cross Stitch, French Knot, Fly Stitch, Satin Stitch, Chain Stitch, & Blanket Stitch

#### Tip to past self: Be careful with the details on the sampler. In other words, do not stitch the entire circle and make more work for yourself. Also, get an embroidery hoop.
