The Plushy Redux Assignment required writing a program to direct the behavior of the Circuit Plushy with the button and the switch using nested if statements. 
The program prints whether LEDs are off or on depending on the button and switch, and it should print that the three LEDs are on only when the button is pressed AND the switch is on.

Tip to past self: Be careful with the curly brackets, and be aware of the difference between "=" and "==".
