Hi, my name is Rebecca Kim. I am a senior majoring in Arabic Studies. Thank you so much for admitting me into this class! I have no experience in sewing or coding, so I'm excited to learn with everyone here. As I have no knowledge of coding, I'm hoping to venture into the field and see what's possible. A boring fact about me is that I have no sleeping schedule to speak of whatsoever.
