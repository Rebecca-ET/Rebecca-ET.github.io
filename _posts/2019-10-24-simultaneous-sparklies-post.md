We coded a program in Arduino that makes 3 ProtoSnap LEDs light up with 3 different patterns in one program.

1. Flash Bulb Firefly: flashes for half a second every 4 seconds

2. Synchronous Firefly: flashes for 0.2 seconds in a series of 3 flashes every 10 seconds

3. Big Dipper Firefly: flashes every 3 seconds, glowing with increasing light

Tip to past self: Being able to work on the assignment in class really sped up the coding process, so as usual, get help from the TAs/professor. The class example for firefly patterns really helped.
