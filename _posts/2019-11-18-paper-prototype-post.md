The circuit in this paper prototype uses conductive thread to connect the buzzer and LEDs to the Lilypad Arduino. The prototype also displays a lithium ion battery, which plugs into the Arduino.
When turned on, the buzzer will play a Christmas song, and the LEDs will begin to glow one by one with increasing brightness and then fade out one after another.
