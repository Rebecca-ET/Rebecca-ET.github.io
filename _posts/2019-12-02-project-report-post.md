*Light-Up Drawstring Bag*

Once the switch is turned on and it is dark enough, the buzzer turns on the song "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" and then the LEDs light up one after another from right to left.
The LEDs form the word الهيوم which means madness caused by excessive love in Arabic. 
I was inspired by the upcoming Christmas holiday to create a little pouch to put a gift inside for a loved one. 

*Materials:*
Lilypad Arduino Board
conductive thread
shiny embroidery floss (mocha brown)
8"x14" muslin (wine red)
scissors
needle
buzzer
light sensor
switch
lithium ion battery 
twine
2 white LEDs
2 yellow LEDs
5 pink LEDs
1 red LED
3 green LEDs
black felt
ruler

*Tips to past self:*
1. When you make your paper prototype, be aware of what will be on the wrong side and what will be on the right side because the position of the ports could change.
2. Note which pins you will be able to use for your inputs/outputs based on whether they are PWM pins, digital pins, or analog pins.
3. "digitalWrite(switchPin, HIGH);" ---> This line of code is important to ensure that the switch functions.
