Hello, my name is Rebecca Kim. I have always enjoyed activities that involve working with my hands like cross-stitching and crafts. When I discovered a course that combined sewing and coding skills to create wearable technology, I was delighted by the possibility of a creativite project and signed up. I like learning new skills and am especially excited to learn coding for the first time!
